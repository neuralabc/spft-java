###SPFT Behavioural processing in python must be completed in a custom environment to ensure all the nessesary packages/ versions are present. 
A custom environment must be created using an Lmod Module System, which is already present on the server

To create a custom environment with the correct packages on the server please ENTER each of the following lines seperately:
```
conda create -n SPFT python=3.9 jupyterlab=3.6.3 scipy=1.11.3 numpy=1.24.3 pandas=2.0.3 matplotlib=3.7.2
conda activate SPFT
conda install -c conda-forge tslearn=0.6.2
```

Once your custom environment is installed you must enter the environment in a very specific way for the packages to load correctly in python.
First, make sure you're in the base environment, if not ENTER: `conda deactivate`

Once in the base environment please ENTER each of the following lines seperately:
```
module load anaconda
conda activate SPFT
jupyter lab
```

Finally, you port forward as normal to your jupyter notebook and begin behavioural processing.
